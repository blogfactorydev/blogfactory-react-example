# Blogfactory - React Example

**Blogfactory - React Example** is a bare bones implementation of the Blogfactory SDK into a React project.

## Setup Guide

Replace the \[YOUR_PROJECT_ID\] placeholder, in both the blog.js and the blog-post.js files, using your own project id. If you do not have your project id, you can find it at https://blogfactory.dev/posts in the bottom left of the screen.

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
